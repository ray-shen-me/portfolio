MangoChat uses GUN.js to host a decentralized chat application that is capable of sending encrypted messages using GUN.js's encryption feature and money transfers in the form of $DESO coin.

DeSo is used as the sign-in method and for easily transferring cash in the app.

GUN.js is a decentralized database that uses peers' browsers' storage to store the data. This removes the need of a central authority that stores messages.

Messages are encrypted using public key encryption, so messages can only be decrypted by their recipients.
